How to add network bridge with nmcli (NetworkManager) on Linux
======

I am using Debian Linux 9 "stretch" on the desktop. I would like to create network bridge with NetworkManager. But, I am unable to find the option to add br0. How can I create or add network bridge with nmcli for NetworkManager on Linux?

A bridge is nothing but a device which joins two local networks into one network. It works at the data link layer, i.e., layer 2 of the OSI model. Network bridge often used with virtualization and other software. Disabling NetworkManager for a simple bridge especially on Linux Laptop/desktop doesn't make any sense. The nmcli tool can create Persistent bridge configuration without editing any files. **This page shows how to create a bridge interface using the Network Manager command line tool called nmcli**.



### How to create/add network bridge with nmcli

The procedure to add a bridge interface on Linux is as follows when you want to use Network Manager:

1. Open the Terminal app
2. Get info about the current connection:
```
nmcli con show
```
3. Add a new bridge:
```
nmcli con add type bridge ifname br0
```
4. Create a slave interface:
```
nmcli con add type bridge-slave ifname eno1 master br0
```
5. Turn on br0:
```
nmcli con up br0
```

Let us see how to create a bridge, named br0 in details.

### Get current network config

You can view connection from the Network Manager GUI in settings:

Another option is to type the following command:
```
$ nmcli con show
$ nmcli connection show --active 
```

I have a "Wired connection 1" which uses the eno1 Ethernet interface. My system has a VPN interface too. I am going to setup a bridge interface named br0 and add, (or enslave) an interface to eno1.

### How to create a bridge, named br0

```
$ sudo nmcli con add ifname br0 type bridge con-name br0
$ sudo nmcli con add type bridge-slave ifname eno1 master br0
$ nmcli connection show
```

You can disable STP too:
```
$ sudo nmcli con modify br0 bridge.stp no
$ nmcli con show
$ nmcli -f bridge con show br0
```
The last command shows the bridge settings including disabled STP:
```
bridge.mac-address:                     --
bridge.stp:                             no
bridge.priority:                        32768
bridge.forward-delay:                   15
bridge.hello-time:                      2
bridge.max-age:                         20
bridge.ageing-time:                     300
bridge.multicast-snooping:              yes
```


### How to turn on bridge interface

You must turn off "Wired connection 1" and turn on br0:
```
$ sudo nmcli con down "Wired connection 1"
$ sudo nmcli con up br0
$ nmcli con show
```
Use [ip command][4] to view the IP settings:
```
$ ip a s
$ ip a s br0
```

### Optional: How to use br0 with KVM

Now you can connect VMs (virtual machine) created with KVM/VirtualBox/VMware workstation to a network directly without using NAT. Create a file named br0.xml for KVM using vi command or [cat command][6]:
`$ cat /tmp/br0.xml`
Append the following code:
```
<network>
  <name>br0</name>
  <forward mode="bridge"/>
  <bridge name="br0" />
</network>
```

Run virsh command as follows:
```
# virsh net-define /tmp/br0.xml
# virsh net-start br0
# virsh net-autostart br0
# virsh net-list --all
```
Sample outputs:
```
 Name State Autostart Persistent
----------------------------------------------------------
 br0 active yes yes
 default inactive no yes
```


For more info read the following man page:
```
$ man ip
$ man nmcli
```
